  abstract = {Recommendation systems are widely used to filter massive information. However, they often face the challenges of cold start and sparsity problems, limiting their effectiveness. Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), which focuses on predicting the relative order of user items, has been conventionally proposed to address these challenges for ranking-based recommendation systems. However, conventional BPR approaches rely solely on implicit feedback and lack semantic and visual sentiment information. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal BPR method that incorporates both semantic and visual sentiment to capture more nuanced user preferences and provide more accurate recommendations. Experimental evaluations show that the performance of our proposed method across seven metrics outperforms conventional BPR in both the review-rich and image-rich scenarios, indicating the potential and significance of considering sentiment for improving the performance of BPR recommendation systems.}

  abstract  = {Friendship is the cornerstone to build a social network. In online social networks, statistics show that the leading reason for user to create a new friendship is due to recommendation. Thus the accuracy of recommendation matters. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Personalized Ranking Deep Neural Network (BayDNN) model for friend recommendation in social networks. With BayDNN, we achieve significant improvement on two public datasets: Epinions and Slashdot. For example, on Epinions dataset, BayDNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, with a 5\% improvement on NDCG over the best baseline. The advantages of the proposed BayDNN mainly come from its underlying convolutional neural network (CNN), which offers a mechanism to extract latent deep structural feature representations of the complicated network data, and a novel Bayesian personalized ranking idea, which precisely captures the users' personal bias based on the extracted deep features. To get good parameter estimation for the neural network, we present a fine-tuned pre-training strategy for the proposed BayDNN model based on Poisson and Bernoulli probabilistic models.},

  abstract = {For addressing the “One-Class Collaborative Filtering” (OCCF) problem in recommendation systems, in which the obtained user information is all single-type positive feedback, the current mainstream methods are all based on the idea of pairwise preference learning. The Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) method is a classical representative of such an idea. However, the assumption in BPR, that “users tend to prefer items that they have once interacted”, may not always hold in reality. This is because for non-interacted items, a user may have different perspectives, such as potentially favorite, dislike, or something in between. For mitigating the above-mentioned issue, this paper proposes a Multi-pairwise preference and Similarity based BPR method, termed as MSBPR for brevity. MSBPR utilizes additional auxiliary feedback information to excavate and infer deeper-level user preferences. Subsequently, MSBPR borrows ideas from traditional item/user-based collaborative filtering methods to further divide non-interacted items from the angle of item/user, respectively. Afterwards, MSBPR constructs four preferences on top of the divided items, and accordingly builds up the multiple pairwise preference assumption. To optimize MSBPR, we derive an efficient learning algorithm based on the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. The computational complexity of MSBPR is also theoretically analyzed. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MSBPR over ten state-of-the-art methods on six benchmark real-world datasets.}

  abstract = {{Motivation : Modern molecular technologies allow the collection of large amounts of high-throughput data on the functional attributes of genes. Often multiple technologies and study designs are used to address the same biological question such as which genes are overexpressed in a specific disease state. Consequently, there is considerable interest in methods that can integrate across datasets to present a unified set of predictions. Results : An important aspect of data integration is being able to account for the fact that datasets may differ in how accurately they capture the biological signal of interest. While many methods to address this problem exist, they always rely either on dataset internal statistics, which reflect data structure and not necessarily biological relevance, or external gold standards, which may not always be available. We present a new rank aggregation method for data integration that requires neither external standards nor internal statistics but relies on Bayesian reasoning to assess dataset relevance. We demonstrate that our method outperforms established techniques and significantly improves the predictive power of rank-based aggregations. We show that our method, which does not require an external gold standard, provides reliable estimates of dataset relevance and allows the same set of data to be integrated differently depending on the specific signal of interest.

An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
(just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
in the bibliography.)
The available control fields are:

CTLuse_article_number
"no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_paper
"no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_forced_etal 
"no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
"yes" enables

CTLmax_names_forced_etal
The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
is not greater than this value!

CTLnames_show_etal
The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal

CTLuse_alt_spacing 
"no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
"yes" enables

CTLalt_stretch_factor
If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.

CTLdash_repeated_names
"no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
"yes" enables

CTLname_format_string
The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
guide.
IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,

CTLname_latex_cmd
A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
The default is empty.

CTLname_url_prefix
The prefix text used before URLs.
The default is "[Online]. Available:" A space will be inserted after this
text. If this space is not wanted, just use \relax at the end of the
prefix text.


Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out.
